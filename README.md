# README

So you've decided to run a game of [Mothership™.](https://www.mothershiprpg.com)  The first edition *Warden's Operation Manual* does a great job setting a warden up for success.  

To that end, this repository aims to create a framework so a warden can just start typing.  It is made to be customized to your liking and the files are just markdown so any tool that reads plaintext or markdown files will do the job.

## Considerations

I use Obsidian, and while I built this as a vault for that tool, those specific files have been excluded.  However, the design of this tool will reflect the best practices of information management set forth for that tool.  

You'll need the Mothership™ *Player's Survival Guide* and *Warden's Operation Manual* and little information from those books has been copied here, intentionally. 

## Goals

This is meant to be a community resource with full participation from interested parties via the git repository.  I'm aiming to keep this as barebones as possible while still providing the framework as put forth by the [Tuesday Knight Games](https://www.tuesdayknightgames.com) people. 

## What's Here

**README** - you're reading it  
**\*\/.gitkeep** - an empty file that makes git upload an otherwise empty directory, delete it if it bothers you
**Index** - an index file that could link to important items to expedite use  
**\_Inbox** - the place for notes and items that have yet to be tagged and sorted into their proper place  
**GM Section** - tools, stats, and information for the GM  
**Campaigns** - a folder that contains individual session notes and prep for sessions, grouped by campaign  
**Roster** - all the PCs, alive or dead, and some brief notes  
**Assets** - a folder to contain graphical assets and documents that can be linked throughout the vault   
**Templates** - a folder to contain templates of frequently edited files.  


## Rules of Thumb

- Obsidian seems to work best with small atomic blobs of information - e.g., instead of one note with 50 NPCs, 50 notes with 1 NPC could serve you better.  The Roster might be a good exclusion to this rule.
- While Obsidian has its own internal file recovery methods, nothing beats your own backups and version control.
- You can make some sweet dashboards with tabs or Canvas, but the latter does not yet work on mobile (bummer!)
- To truly leverage the power of Obsidian, making use of the metadata is key.  Tag often.  Link often.  
- There are a few techniques in Obsidian that aren't present in all markdown renderers, specifically wikilinks, highlights, and annotations.
