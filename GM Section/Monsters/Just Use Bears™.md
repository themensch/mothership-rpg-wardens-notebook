# Monsters - The Just Use Bearsâ„¢ Method

Here are 4 community-provided (discord @HailSanta#4554) examples for on-the-fly monster generation:

- C:20 I: 20 1(-): lil goblin bastard; headcrab, random chaff
- C:30 I:30 2(-): cultist, evil dog-sized alien, moderately nasty wildlife
- C:55 I:40; 3(30): badass power armored cyborg, boss human, a grizzly bear; a gaunt walker
- C:75; I:60 8(25): an alpha gaunt; The Alien

> You might want one or two more but, like this is literally it. You should be able to improvise pretty much anything on the fly using this as a rough baseline.

> But the point here is that you shouldn't overthink stablocks. Even for a centerpiece monster, the key is behavior, ecology, and fluff.  The Alpha Gaunt's incoherent, disoriented rage is different than the Spider Tank's implacable pursuit which is different than Brunhildh's theatrical brand of Incredible Violence

> The key ways of differentiating these sort of general statblocks:
> - Give them gear (Brunhildh,  Spider Tank, Troubleshooters, lil goblin bastards with laser cutters...)
> - Switch to pure hits sometimes, no HP (great for really big monsters, lumbering undead, and cyborgs (8(-) and (8(25) play very differently!)
> - Really nasty abilities (Caliban boss monsters and especially the Avatar)
>
> But fluff does most of the work.
